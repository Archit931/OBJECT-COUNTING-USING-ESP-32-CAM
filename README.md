#  Object Counting System using ESP32-CAM & OpenCV

This project implements a real-time *object counting system* using the *ESP32-CAM module* and *Python with OpenCV*. The system captures frames using the ESP32-CAM and processes them on a host computer to detect and count moving objects as they cross a virtual boundary.



##  Technologies Used

-  Python 3  
- OpenCV (Computer Vision Library)  
- Motion Detection & Contour Tracking  
-  ESP32-CAM (for video capture)  
-  Serial Communication (UART) between ESP32-CAM and host system  
-  Arduino IDE (for ESP32 programming)



##  Files Included

- esp32_cam_object_count.ino → Arduino sketch for configuring ESP32-CAM  
- object_counter.py → Python script for receiving frames and counting objects using OpenCV  
- project_report.pdf → Final project report (public version)



##  Report Info

This project was developed and submitted as part of academic coursework at the *Institute of Technical Education & Research (ITER)* under the *B.Tech Computer Science curriculum*. The uploaded report has been cleaned of personal identifiers.

This video illustrates the system in action, showing how objects are tracked and counted as they pass through the detection zone.



##  Note

This is a *group academic project* built for the *Robotics Programming Workshop (RPW2)* course as part of the 6th semester deliverables. The main aim was to explore real-time object detection using a lightweight embedded system like ESP32-CAM.
